On a rainy October afternoon, I was walking to  catch my train when a woman attempted to stop me on the street. Like most people, I do not like to be interrupted when I am in the flow of stride. But I decided to stop and listen to her. 

She was a street fundraiser, and like most good street fundraisers, she was able to keep me engaged long enough to hook me into signing up for direct debit for a donation. I have worked as a street fundraiser before. It is not an easy job, so I empathize with the profession. We talked about what I did for a living, and when I told her I work with data, she was intrigued. And then she said: *"I could never work with data. I can barely use a spreadsheet."* 

Whenever I meet a woman who believes she can't work with data. My gut sinks. I make it a point to tell data-hesitant women — as I call them that I do not have a technical background. I explained that I was not interested in becoming a data professional when I signed up to study International relations. I picked this subject because It helped me make sense of the world, and I still use the skills and tools I picked up to understand the seemingly chaotic world we live in today.

Towards the end of my university career, I began to understand that I was approaching education with the wrong mindset—*grades and getting a job*. I realized that freedom was the implicit outcome of knowledge. I took advantage of my university's library, acquiring as much information as my brain could handle. As a result, and funnily enough, the grades I began to achieve were better, and by senior year, I had rewired my brain to become focused on learning as the goal.

The story about how I overcame my struggles in school is why my stomach sinks to hear women tell themselves they are just not good at data. Because it's a reminder of what I told myself and what my teachers told me. So, why am I willing to share my previous struggles for everyone to read on the internet? Well, the first reason is apparent. It's an opportunity to brag. The second reason is that I want women to take advantage of the wealth of rich resources and leverage their uniqueness to join a profession that needs more women. 

Women are half the world's population, and the data discipline would benefit hugely from our perspective. The possibilities are endless. Plus, it is an excellent skill to have in your back pocket. What is the worst thing that could happen? 

You might try it and decide that it's not for you. But you will come closer to understanding how companies are targeting you based on your purchases. Or maybe you will become stingier with the information you provide when filling that online order. 

My point is that you won't know until you try. And trust me, once you look through the curtain, the world will not look the same again.

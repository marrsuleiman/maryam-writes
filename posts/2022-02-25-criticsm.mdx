# *"It is not the critic who counts"*

The great Theodore Roosevelt shared those words during a speech at Sorbonne, Paris, in 1910. Reading those words and the words that followed for the first time one hundred and eleven years later was the start of my mid-life crisis. Before this experience, I had watched movies that convinced me that only middle-aged white men could have a mid-life crisis. So I did not see my crisis coming nor have the right skills to cope with it. 

I had spent much of my life worrying about other people's opinions and dancing to the beat of their drums. Unfortunately, I never heard *my drums*, so when I tried to listen to my songs, all I heard were muffled sounds. It took a lot of hard work to get them to beat loud again. A life lesson I won't be forgetting anytime soon. I have my handwritten copy of the speech stuck to my fridge, which I read almost every morning. It has become my morning sermon. 

The second sentence in Roosevelt's speech says *"not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles"*. Unfortunately, most women are lured into believing that other people's critiques and feedback are more important. And in the social media commentariat age, it is open season. The idea that other people's criticisms should not matter to me was confusing but enlightening at the same time. I had woken up. I was disoriented, angry, and  *weirdly* relieved. Relieved because I now knew I had a choice in how I received disappointments and other people's opinions. And that choice is what has led me to start sharing this blog despite my fears and internal conflicts.

One of the conflicts I had to contend with was how to resolve the conflict between being a writer and receiving feedback from editors, readers, and peers. The truth is, I don't try to *anymore*. A mentor said to me, *"Just set a schedule and post. It does not matter if it's perfect"*. I was apprehensive about her method, but it's worked. I decided I was writing for myself ***first***, and it didn't matter if other people agreed with me. It was easy, and it is something that I look forward to doing every week.

Of course, there is a panic every Sunday when I realize that I don't have a topic to write and post for the upcoming week. But I sit down, open my laptop, open a text editor, and type until I pick up on a theme. The freestyle part of writing is the part I enjoy, the freedom to splash a small piece of my spirit into words. I like the process of editing my content, but it is a humbling process. It is humbling because I always have to admit my professors were right. They taught me to always read my articles aloud to myself before I printed them. And they were right. 

The editing process is where my internal critic shows up. You see, we already have our own very own critics, but like external critics, they are not in charge. We are. Critics ***might*** have feedback that we ***may*** find helpful, especially if they can point us to examples where their suggestions have been successful. And sometimes, external critics, like our internal critics, give unproductive and directionless feedback. At best, critical voices believe they are just being realistic or protecting you and, at worst, projecting their failures and insecurities onto you. 

It is tempting to go to our friends, partners, and families for feedback. They are the groups of people who have our best interests at heart. And while this is true, they also have a vested interest in our well-being. As a result, they want to protect us from perceived harm. Unfortunately, they are the people who are least likely to give us helpful feedback. 

Here is how you can begin to tell the difference between helpful feedback that could be worth listening to and useless feedback that you can ignore. 

***Useful feedback***

1) Feedback from the people you are trying to reach. If you write documentation for software, it makes sense to listen and incorporate feedback from your readers. They are the people you are writing for. The only caveat is that the collected feedback must be data-driven, not anecdotal.

2) Feedback from people trying to get a resource from â€” usually financial. But it could be other soft resources, like their support on a project that you are passionate about.

***Useless feedback*** 

Everything else. The only way to know if you will enjoy and succeed at anything in this life is to try it. Therefore, listening to the opinions and concerns of the people sitting ringside will discourage you from your endeavour. They are not the ones who will live in regret. You are.

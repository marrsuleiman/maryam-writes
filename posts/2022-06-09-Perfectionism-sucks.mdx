When I was nine, I had already internalized the message that being perfect was the blueprint to solving all my problems. The message of perfectionism continued to be reinforced at school, at home, and in my consumed media. The only place where perfection was not the default was in books. I did not know that books would be where I would look to find permission to be imperfect.

The ~~professional~~ work environment is a minefield of perfectionism, deadlines, and games. We accommodate and accept this reality and do not even question the system's absurdity. Until we are forced to.

Recently, I ended a job that I was very excited to start. Within the first two weeks of starting the job, I cried after a call with my boss. A red flagâ€”*feeling horrible about myself* was flapping in the wind, but I ignored how I felt. I wanted to prove that I was perfect. I decided I could take rudeness, lack of direction, and spin them into gold because I am a strong woman. *What I should have done was quit and tell the company exactly why*. But I did not. I decided to lean into perfectionism because I am a writer, and I should be producing the perfect documentation with no mistakes and know everything.

Like I said, quitting earlier was the smart and healthy move and a hard lesson I have learned because of the amount of time it took me to recover from perfectionism's emotional and mental exhaustion. 

As hard as it was for me to acknowledge and share parts of this experience, I am sharing it because it made me reflect on the red flags I ignored against my better judgment. I was so eager about my new profession that I had not considered the possibility I was dancing to the tune of perfectionism and walking across a minefield of games and unrealistic expectations. 

Perfectionism can be defined as the need to be or appear to be perfect or even to believe it's possible to achieve perfection. 

I used to apply for jobs that included *" you are a perfectionist"* in the person specification. I would jump at the chance to show how much of a perfectionist I was and apply because I thought that I was perfect for the job. And then I would wonder why I would leave the interview feeling wounded, raw, and looking forward to a glass of wine at 2 pm on a Tuesday. I don't apply for those jobs anymore. 

As I have learned, perfectionism is not the value you bring to the table in your professional or personal life. Perfectionism is **NOT** a skill as much as society would like it to be. And anyone who has convinced you that it is something to aspire to is ill-informed, and the mindset sets you up for failure. 

Instead of striving to be perfect, I believe that aspiring to improve your skill is a healthy way to go about things. Here are six reasons why;

- Improvement is achievable. Perfection *is not*. 
- Improvement is measurable. *Have you ever heard of a metric for measuring perfection?* There's a reason a metric does not exist; goal posts are easier to move when you strive for perfection. 
- You will actually learn something new.
- Improvement teaches you more about yourself.
- No one can take the improved skill once you have it. 


And finally, improvement inspires you to take action. Perfectionism encourages procrastination because you won't take action until the timing is perfect. It took me six hours spread across three days to get this website up and running. Once I decided that I wanted to improve, *not perfect*, a technical skill I had, I took action, made mistakes, and got it done. It's not perfect, but it's mine. 

I wanted to start a blog about a year ago, but I was waiting for the perfect time, looking for the ideal topic to write about. And I was always a reason why it was not the right time to start a blog. 

Perfectionism sucks. Don't let it drain you.

title: What's the problem?

I once heard a story about a particular actor struggling to land his first big role in Hollywood. He would go on numerous auditions to meet producers, but he never landed the roles he auditioned for. Frustrated and broke *(i imagine)*, he had an epiphany. He was looking at job hunting the wrong way and probably coming off as desperate. *This is my best guess because that's how I used to think until I heard the story.*

The actor realized that auditioning and filling a part in a movie solved one of a producer's problems —finding the right talent for the role. So the actor reframed how he thought about himself as an actor and started to present himself as the answer to a specific problem. He changed his perspective on job hunting and got himself a pretty sweet starring role. 

The more experience I have, the more I see myself as a problem solver, and you should try to change your mindset. It does wonders for self-esteem. When I was in a rush to get a job, I never considered that the hiring manager, recruiter, and companies were trying to solve a problem —finding a competent person who would fit into their already complicated and sometimes dysfunctional relationships. 

When I heard the story about the actor, I started to see myself as the potential answer to the problem they were trying to solve. Although the job and person specifications should tell you what problem they *think* you can solve. I would encourage you to ask that question at the interview. 

"So, what problems are you hoping to solve by filling this position?" 

It's a bit unorthodox, but the problem solver (the hiring manager) should know the problem, and if they can't give you a straight answer— that's a problem. Because you would be starting a relationship with someone who does not know what they need. I've seen a few projects crash and burn because no one knew the problem, and as the newbie, you might be the fall guy or gal.

Take any Technical writer position you find on job boards. Those vaccines do not exist in a vacuum, and you should never see them as such. I know it's obvious, but it's probably not really on your radar when looking for a job. *And it should be*. For example, a Technical Writer is more than just a person who can write and code. In a start-up environment, chances are that the documentation available was written by an Engineer or Developer as they were working on the product. To appeal to a broader range of customers, the company has now realized that it needs to hire a Technical Writer. The in-house recruiters speak to the core teams, and they draw up a wish list, as in the qualities they believe the person must have. Ideally, these qualities are realistic, and this person actually exists and would want to work with the company for the compensation package the company offers.  

Great, you are interested, and you believe you meet a few of the core competencies. However, it is not enough to be competent because competency can only get you so far.

Can the hiring manager articulate their expectations?
Do the core teams even like each other?
Are they respectful of each other?
Do they have a sense of fulfillment?
Do they feel like they are valued as employees?
Do they value each other's time?
Do they trust each other's judgment?

The last question is crucial because, in my experience, I have only needed to meet a person twice before deciding whether I can work with them. The final decision was sometimes not mine to make. But I've been privy to conversations where an additional interview was suggested because of different egos and agendas disagreeing on a candidate. And believe me, if there are more than three stages of an interview, they do not trust each other's judgment. And as a Technical Writer, your team needs to trust your judgment and believe you can get the job done. And if a company has more than three stages of an interview, you can expect to jump through multiple hoops and trials before you are accepted as a Subject Matter Expert. In US pop culture, that process is called Hazing. 

You are there to solve a problem, not run through a gauntlet of unrealistic expectations. Don't be afraid to ask about the problem.

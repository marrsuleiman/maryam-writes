Working from home has encouraged me to reevaluate how I show up and navigate the workplace. As I reflect on my experiences, I have come to terms with the fact that I had unknowingly and consistently sacrificed parts of myself to fit into the workplace. By playing, the role of *" team player"*, my boundaries were up for debate.

Ever seen any of the Jurassic Park movies? There is always a scene where a dinosaur is surrounded by an *"unimpregnable"*  fence. As the plot unfolds, the dinosaur begins to test how unimpregnable the wall *really* is. My boundaries used to be the fence, and other people's expectations and egos were the dinosaurs. 

As a keen observer of British politics, I consider the government falling apart to be a case study on toxic work environments and a lesson on why values are so important. I followed the story with intrigue and bewilderment. I watched as *supposedly grown-up people* relinquish the last vestiges of their integrity to defend the indefensible to protect one man and~~their jobs~~their and statuses. 

As I was judging them ~~in disgust~~ on my moral high horse. I took time to reflect because something uncomfortable lingered in my thoughtsâ€” I was a hypocrite. In the past,  I have been guilty of tolerating, excusing, and even rationalizing poor behavior and incompetence from my managers and colleagues. Even when every moral fiber of being was screaming at me to stand up for myself. And the price that I paid for not living my values was steep. 
 
The story of Mr. Johnson's demise as Prime Minister is not so much about him but about all of us and the behaviors we explain away and tolerate in our workplaces. For example,  I once had a manager who would fall asleep every afternoon after lunch. We did not have an open-plan office, so no one knew except me. I was shocked the first time it happened, but I excused it as a one-off. *Who doesn't get sleepy after lunch?* Then it happened every single day until I left the job. I told myself that it was not any of my business. What I did not realize at the time was that for each hour that he slept, I was making decisions that he was supposed to make because I did not want to wake him up from his afternoon slumber. So really, it was *my business* as I was picking up the slack as he slept.

But here's the part that worsened the situation, he held me up to ridiculous standards during my performance reviews. As far as he was concerned, I was not doing enough as a team player and had to work harder. It was funny to me and embarrassing for him. He was a tragic manager, and I left the company the second I had the opportunity. 

I recalled this experience because it shows how workplaces can influence us. By that, I mean the values of the people we work with. We can become shadows of ourselves. This is why our core values are so important because they are codes that we live by, and they are what keep will keep us from moving away from ourselves. 

Years later, I was fortunate to work with another manager. During one of my performance reviews, she said to me *" when you are on your death bed, you are not going to be thinking if only I had worked harder"*. 

That was a moment of clarity for me, and that's when the story of what I consider to be ***my*** real job/career began. I decided that the only job that mattered was the one I made for myself. Integrity, courage, decency, and curiosity would be the tools that I would use to thrive in the workplace. They would not be shields or armor to haul around because they are heavy and prone to attack. But rays of light shining from within, which might be dimmed sometimes but can continuously be replenished. 

When you consider values as important as experience and skills, you will begin to see yourself in a different light. I advise using your interview questions to test if a hiring panel can show you examples of where they have lived their company values. 

For example, when a company's careers page highlights that integrity and accountability are vital to them. A good question to ask a hiring manager or panel would be: *Tell me about a time when you had to audit a process because a mistake had been made? What did you learn from the process?*

You have your answer if they can't give you a concrete answer. A functioning workplace should be able to tell you about how the audit process works to learn from mistakes and, more importantly, remain accountable.

Do not approach the team player trope like a sorority you are dying to belong to. Sooner or later, you will have to pay the price, and the price is always steep as the current government cabinet is learning. 

Dare to ask the questions.

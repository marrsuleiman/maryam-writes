There are days that I believe that working from home as a consequence of social distancing measures has encouraged me to reclaim some of my boundaries. I felt I had sacrificed parts of myself to be part of a team and for a paycheck. To be a team player, I have acquiesced to some audacious requests from colleagues in the past. Ever seen any of the Jurassic Park movies? There is always a scene where a dinosaur is surrounded by an *"unimpregnable" *  fence. As the film progresses, the dinosaur begins to test how *"impregnable"* the wall is. That's how I can sense when my professional or personal boundaries are being pushed. My boundaries are the fence, and other people's egos are the dinosaur. 

As a keen observer of British politics in the last two years, I know something about toxic work environments. As I observed the political drama unfold, I followed the story with intrigue and bewilderment. I watched the souls of *supposedly grown-up people* depart from their bodies as they relinquished the last vestiges of their integrity to defend the indefensible to protect one man and their jobs. I thought to myself. These people have no boundaries. Because if they did, there's no way they would put up with this mess. 

I spent some time thinking about my judgment of the people on the TV  before I decided to write with righteous indignation. I took time to reflect because something uncomfortable lingered within me in the background. I was judging them *who wouldn't*. But the shadowy figure I am talking about is my hypocrisy. I had let some despicable behavior from my superiors slide even when every moral fiber of being was screaming at me to stand up for myself, and I didn't. And the price that I paid for not living my values was steep. 
 
The story of Mr. Johnson's demise as Prime Minister is not so much about him but about all of us and the behaviors we excuse, rationalize and tolerate in our workplaces. For example,  I once had a manager who would fall asleep in the office. We did not have an open-plan office. Each team sat in a different office. Like clockwork, he would doze off between 3 and 4 pm every day. I was shocked the first time it happened, but I excused it as a one-off. Who doesn't get sleepy after lunch? Then it happened every single day until I left the job. I told myself that it was not any of my business. What I did not realize at the time was that for each hour that he slept, I was making decisions that he was supposed to make because I did not want to wake him up from his afternoon slumber. So really, it was *my business* as I was picking up the slack as he slept.

But here's the part that worsened the situation: he was holding me up to ridiculous standards during the performance reviews. As far as he was concerned, I was not doing enough as a team player and had to work harder. It was funny to me and embarrassing for him. It took mastery of emotional reflexes that I had not to blurt out the words *" George, your feedback would be believable if you did not fall asleep every afternoon after lunch"*. But I did not. I sat quietly and allowed two men to attack my work ethic and competence. Suffice to say, George was a tragic manager, and I left the company the second I had the opportunity to do so. I recalled this experience because it is an example of how workplaces, and by that, I mean the people we interact with, can influence us before we know it. We become shadows of ourselves that we do not even recognize. This is why our core values are so important because values are codes that we live by, and they are what keep will keep us from debasing ourselves. 

Years later, I was fortunate to work with another manager, and in one of my performance reviews, she said to me :*"when you are on your death bed, you are not going to be thinking, if only I had worked harder"*. 

That was a moment of clarity for me, and that's when the story of a real job/career began. I decided that the only job that mattered was the one I made for myself, a job for me and not for anyone else. Integrity, courage, decency, and curiosity would be the tools that I would use to thrive. They would not be shields or armor because they are heavy and prone to attack, but lights shining from within that makeup, which might be dimmed but can continuously be replenished. Boundaries are important not because they keep the bad things away but because they are what allows us to sleep at night. 

Don't drink the Kool-Aid and debase yourself. Sooner or later, you will have to pay the price; believe me, the price is always steep.

Working from home has encouraged me to reevaluate how I show up and navigate the workplace. As I reflect on my experiences, I have come to terms with the fact that I had unknowingly and consistently sacrificed parts of myself to fit into the workplace. By playing, the role of *" team player"*, my boundaries were up for debate.

Ever seen any of the Jurassic Park movies? There is always a scene where a dinosaur is surrounded by an *"unimpregnable"*  fence. As the plot unfolds, the dinosaur begins to test how *"impregnable"* the wall really is. That's how I can feel and sense when my boundaries are being pushed. My boundaries are the fence, and other people's expectations and egos are the dinosaurs. 

As a keen observer of British politics, I consider the government falling apart to be a  case study on toxic work environments and a lesson on why values are so important. I followed the story with intrigue and bewilderment. I watched *supposedly grown-up people* relinquish the last vestiges of their integrity to defend the indefensible to protect one man and their jobs. 

As I was judging them ~~in disgust~~ on my moral high horse. I took time to reflect because something uncomfortable lingered in my thoughtsâ€” I was a hypocrite. In the past,  I have been guilty of tolerating, excusing, and even rationalizing poor behavior from my managers and colleagues. Even when every moral fiber of being was screaming at me to stand up for myself. And the price that I paid for not living my values was steep. 
 
The story of Mr. Johnson's demise as Prime Minister is not so much about him but about all of us and the behaviors we explain away and tolerate in our workplaces. For example,  I once had a manager who would fall asleep every afternoon after lunch. We did not have an open-plan office, so no one knew except me. I was shocked the first time it happened, but I excused it as a one-off. *Who doesn't get sleepy after lunch?* Then it happened every single day until I left the job. I told myself that it was not any of my business. What I did not realize at the time was that for each hour that he slept, I was making decisions that he was supposed to make because I did not want to wake him up from his afternoon slumber. So really, it was *my business* as I was picking up the slack as he slept.

But here's the part that worsened the situation, he held me up to ridiculous standards during my performance reviews. As far as he was concerned, I was not doing enough as a team player and had to work harder. It was funny to me and embarrassing for him. Suffice to say, George was a tragic manager, and I left the company the second I had the opportunity to do so. 

I recalled this experience because it is an example of how workplaces, and by that, I mean the people we interact with, can influence us before we know it. We become shadows of ourselves that we do not even recognize. This is why our core values are so important because values are codes that we live by, and they are what keep will keep us from debasing ourselves. 

Years later, I was fortunate to work with another manager. During one of my performance reviews, she said to me :*" when you are on your death bed, you are not going to be thinking if only I had worked harder"*. 

That was a moment of clarity for me, and that's when the story of what I consider to be *my* real job/career began. I decided that the only job that mattered was the one I made for myself, a job for me and not for anyone else. Integrity, courage, decency, and curiosity would be the tools that I would use to thrive. They would not be shields or armor because they are heavy and prone to attack. But rays of light shining from within, which might be dimmed sometimes but can continuously be replenished. Boundaries are important not because they keep the bad things away but because they are what allows us to sleep at night. 

I advise using your interview questions to test if a hiring panel can show you examples of where they have lived their company values. 

For example, the company careers page discusses how integrity and accountability are essential. A good question to ask a hiring manager or panel would be: Tell me when you had to audit a process because a mistake had been made? What did you learn from the process?

You have your answer if they can't give you a concrete answer. A functioning workplace should be able to tell you about how they audit their work to learn from their mistakes and, more importantly, remain accountable.

Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Sooner or later, you will have to pay the price; believe me, the price is always steep.

title: Rejection emails

One Saturday morning, I broke one of my rules, no work on the weekends. I was in the mood for some doom scrolling, and social media was not cutting it, so I went into my emails. 
For the last four years, I have learned to separate life-admin emails from my ~~personal~~ other emails to control what I see and when. I checked my life-admin inbox, and it did not disappoint. 

It was a series of automated rejection emails, and I clenched for inevitable nausea. But I noticed a subtle difference in my body's reaction to the emails. Notably, my stomach had no jump and no gut wrench. Before this new experience, I would puff in frustration and spend the day feeling ashamed and unworthy. But I didn't do that. I read each email —*I know I sound like a masochist*. I had the same thought as I scrolled through the emails, but something weird happened to my face. I was smiling. Even now, as I narrate the experience, I am smiling.

I spent the weekend reflecting on why I was relaxed about being rejected. After all, I had invested considerable time tailoring my CV and doing company research. The emails all had the same thing in common. I had never paid attention to the nature of the emails before, but this time I did. They were vague, indicating that ***the company*** ~~wanted to see other people~~ preferred other candidates.

After some reflection, I realized that my smile came from a place of knowing the rejections had nothing to do with me or my qualifications. And it would help if you internalized this message, it's hard to accept, but it's true. Despite the rejections, I felt good about myself — hopeful and confident.

Here's a more productive way to examine and learn from rejection emails.  

The emails are **generic**, and they don't tell you much except someone else is more qualified than you. But there's no way for you to test that theory. Some fifty to a hundred people likely got the same emails. So you are not alone, even though it can feel that way.

Your salary ~~was too high~~ did not match their budget. If there was a mandatory salary field on the application form and you filled it with your honest expectations, ~~you were outside their budget~~ the company could not afford you. It does not mean that you should lower your salary expectations. It means you need to widen the scope of how you research potential employers and find the ones that _can pay you_ what _you want_. For example, it helps to speak to people who do similar work at the company. Connect with them on LinkedIn, set up a call, and be prepared to ask them about salary, culture, and workloads. We Brits think it's taboo to ask people about their salaries, but you would be surprised how comfortable people are with telling a stranger their salary ranges. Ex-employees too. 

Yes, you will have to negotiate. *Always* negotiate.

You were overqualified for the job, *especially* if you are a woman. A hard pill to swallow, but we all fear rejection, so we go for the safe route. An experienced and *honest* hiring manager will reject a candidate they believe will get bored of the job and leave within a year. *Psst! It is an open secret in the hiring process, and you won't know this unless you have been on the other side of the hiring process*. So aim higher and challenge yourself. 

The other candidates were better on paper. Unfortunately, the application process is a sales game. So look at your CV again and get a career coach to review it. Career coaches excel at pulling out the best in people and reflecting those qualities back at you. The process enables you to translate those qualities into skills you can add to your CV and talk about during interviews. And if you can't afford to pay a career coach, here are some resources I've picked on along the way;

- Career podcasts are an invaluable resource. Some pretty amazing people share a wealth of wisdom you can listen to when you are out and about. See your favorite podcast streaming services for more details. 
- Linkedin is a free research resource — *if you know how to advantage of it*. Take the time to look at how people have described themselves and their accomplishments if they have held a position you are interested in exploring. 
- Consider building a relationship with a mentor. It's *technically* not free because it's a give-and-take relationship, but it applies.

    - ADPList is a free mentorship platform that connects mentees with mentors. Sign up and explore the possibility of connecting with hundreds of potential mentors. I use it, and I've had insightful conversations with people from around the globe. It helps to be prepared with questions as each session lasts thirty minutes.
    - Or maybe there's someone you admire in your current job or on your Linkedin network. Offer to take them out for coffee in exchange for an hour of their time. Don't worry about taking from them. Mentors are very candid about the fact that they also gain from the relationship.

I started this post by sharing a vulnerable moment in the hope that when you get to the end of it, you understand that, in most cases, we can't control who, when and how rejection comes. The only thing we can control is the knowledge that you are enough and that there's always room for self-improvement. And like I said in my previous post about perfectionism, an improved skill is yours to keep. 

If you teach a ~~man~~ person to fish, you feed ~~him~~ them for a lifetime.
